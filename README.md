## MovieLens Movie Ratings Visualization, Winter 2021-22

### Preliminary Plots

Contributors: Carolyn Lu, Emily Pan, Sarah Yun, Teresa Huang 

Plotted given data to observe features of the dataset. 

### Matrix Factorization Visualizations

Contributors: Emily Pan

Used many types of matrix factorization to model MovieLens data, and visualize dataset on 2D map projection onto results of matrix factorization. Method 1  uses from-scratch implementation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Method 2 experiments with bias on Suprise SVD implementation. Method 3a and 3b explores unbiased off-the-shelf implementations in the Surprise library: SVD, SVDpp, NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization).

## Loan Status Predictor, Winter 2021-22

Contributors: Emily Pan, Sarah Yun

Experimented with different models to predict the status of a loan based on features of the customer. Sole contributor to Neural Network code, joint effort for other classifiers: MLP, Logistic Regression, SGD, Random Forest. Achieved best accuracy of 70% on hidden test set. 


## Putt Putt Caltech, Spring 2021

Contributors: Depei Li, Emily Pan, Joy Shi, Neha Dalia

C-based game of Putt-Putt, similar to Mini Golf on iOS GamePigeon except with music, power-ups, obstacles, coins, and more!
