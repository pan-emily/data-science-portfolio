## Citadel Summer Invitational Datathon. Text, Demography, and Geography: An Analysis of LendingClub, Summer 2022

Contributors: (insert team members) 

Given a dataset of accepted and rejected loan characteristics from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending service, we sought to investigate three main areas: 
	1. How does social disclosure impact interest and default rates? 
	2. How are immigrants impacted by LendingClub and its 2016 changes? 
	3. How important is geography for LendingClubâ€™s growth?
We used Natural Language Processing, Principal Component Analysis, Random Effects Regression, and Spatial Regression. 

## Shakespeare Sonnet Generator and Hidden Markov Model Visualizer, Winter 2021-22

Contributors: Emily Pan

Implemented a Hidden Markov Model to generate new Shakespearean sonnets based on Shakespeare's past work. Implemented features to generate rhyming lines so that Shakespeare's rhyme scheme is preserved. Also implemented functionality to control number of syllables per line. Adapted model to generate other poetic forms, like haikus, Petrarchan sonnets, limericks. 


## MovieLens Movie Ratings Visualization, Winter 2021-22

### Preliminary Plots

Contributors: Carolyn Lu, Sarah Yun, Teresa Huang 

Plotted given data to observe features of the dataset. Used sklearn's imputers to fill missing values. 

### Matrix Factorization Visualizations

Contributors: Emily Pan

Used many types of matrix factorization to model MovieLens data, and visualize dataset on 2D map projection onto results of matrix factorization. Method 1  uses from-scratch implementation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Method 2 experiments with bias on Suprise SVD implementation. Method 3a and 3b explores unbiased off-the-shelf implementations in the Surprise library: SVD, SVDpp, NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization).

## Loan Status Predictor, Winter 2021-22

Contributors: Emily Pan, Sarah Yun

Experimented with different models to predict the status of a loan based on features of the customer. Sole contributor to Neural Network code, joint effort for other classifiers: MLP, Logistic Regression, SGD, Random Forest. Achieved best accuracy of 70% on hidden test set.
